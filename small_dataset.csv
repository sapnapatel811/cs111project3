I love how he sets up his methods classes for open discussion and felt that it as a good way of understanding the concepts as well as his and my peers views and in turn made me think about mhow I would use those concepts in my own teaching. I too also like Mastery learning making sure the concepts are learned correctly like in conducting. That is a vital skill for all teachers and is best that it can be done over until it is done right.
